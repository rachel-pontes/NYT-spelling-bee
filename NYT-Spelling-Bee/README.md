# NYT Spelling Bee is a game in which players try to make words from a set of seven unique letters. Out of the 7 letters one letter is the core letter and must be used for every word found. In the app you are only allowed to input the 7 letters but for this replit version the input must be validated. 

## There are different ranks you can get based on the amount of points won so far. Each day there is a different set of letters, and thus a whole different set of words to guess. Words must be more than 4 letters long and you can use a letter more than once. Every game holds a “Pangram” which gives 7 additional points. If a word is 4 letters it is worth 1 point, every other word is its length in points. Getting 70% of the available points results in the rank Genius. Getting every word gives you the title of Queen Bee.
